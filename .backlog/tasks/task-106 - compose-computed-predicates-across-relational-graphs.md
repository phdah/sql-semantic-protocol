## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Consume canonical expression and predicate proofs from TASK-101..105 across actual relational operators and physical-source DAG construction. Extend, do not replace, the existing TASK-68 generic graph/source realization engine.

**TASK-70 child, step 6/8.** Implement this task in a fresh PR targeting `main` once the previous dependency has merged. The TASK-70 parent owns the [dependency-ordered queue](task-70%20-%20solve-expression-and-predicate-variants.md); this child MUST NOT depend on the parent (no dependency cycle). A green, bounded increment is mergeable but does not complete this child unless every criterion below is independently verified.

**Release contract:** Produce canonical, source-independent, parser-agnostic typed outcomes with strongest provable value domains and deterministic proof strength (exact, impossible, residual) for SQL TRUE and NOT TRUE. Preserve explicit residuals and never move missing semantics to sql-tdg. Protocol 3.0.0 release remains gated by TASK-91.

## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Propagate typed expression truth, output domains and stable column references through WHERE/HAVING/QUALIFY, SELECT and computed aliases, JOIN keys/ON conditions, GROUP BY and aggregation, and computed INSERT/UPDATE/MERGE assignments where existing operator semantics permit.
- [ ] #2 Derive strongest justified output value domains, lower/upper bounds and inclusion/exclusion after each supported operator and materialization boundary; preserve lineage and producer reference identity without SQL AST or consumer heuristics.
- [ ] #3 Lift a single consistent, jointly satisfying typed source-row assignment through shared/multiple physical producers for positive and NOT TRUE rejected targets, including duplicate, NULL, grouping, join and write-state interactions.
- [ ] #4 Prove impossibility only for necessary contradictions or complete closed-world absence; ensure partial producers, unsupported aggregations, lossy inverses, missing source constraints and unverified DML semantics report typed residual, never fabricated feasible plans.
- [ ] #5 Exercise raw SQL/dbt with complete physical source rows, filtered joins, groups/HAVING, aliases, ordered DML and joint terminal negative tests against DuckDB where supported; update canonical witness/API, emitted schema, adapters, code map and coverage evidence.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation and verification

- **Parent:** [TASK-70](task-70%20-%20solve-expression-and-predicate-variants.md), still **In Progress** until TASK-108 verifies all six original acceptance criteria.
- **Delivery:** one focused PR to `main`; finish all the child AC before marking it Done and verify complete relevant CI after implementing (not after every commit). Update canonical API/schema/docs, adapter parity and coverage evidence as applicable.
- **Scope boundary:** Reuse TASK-68/93..100 physical machinery and TASK-79 schema laws. This child owns the **missing computed-expression integration**, not an independent rewrite of joins, groups or DML nor global end-to-end TASK-89 certification.
- **Next:** After completion, pick **TASK-107**.
